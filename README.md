This is a test environment to demonstrate how a react.js frontend can communicate with a node.js backend
via websockets. The backend will initiate a connection with a mosquitto mqtt broker and show the frontend
what topics the mqtt web-app client can subscribe to allow the mqtt web-app client to publish messages to
the broker which other mqtt clients will subscribe to.
